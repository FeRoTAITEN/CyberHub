We are adding a new feature to the Cyber Hub platform: a secure, permission-based survey system.

Feature Overview:
- Users with specific permission (e.g., `can_create_survey`) can create new surveys and generate unique invitation links (URLs).
- Each link is a unique, secure UUID token that leads to a standalone public-facing survey form.
- Invitees open the link, fill in their basic information (name, department, etc.), then complete a satisfaction survey.
- Responses are submitted and stored securely in the system and linked to the corresponding invite and survey.

Requirements:
- Follow existing UI layout, theming, and translation structure (ar.json and en.json).
- Support both Arabic and English with full dynamic i18n.
- Survey and responses must be responsive, accessible, and secure.
- Use existing components, hooks, and utility functions where possible.
- All comments must be written in English only.
- Each invitation URL should expire after use or within a configurable time window (e.g., 48 hours).

Technical Notes:
- Use a stateless and scalable design â€” the platform supports auto-scaling and load balancing.
- Survey content (questions) should be stored in the database and rendered dynamically.
- Responses should be saved securely and tied to the invite token.

Before implementation:
- Check for existing form components or response handlers.
- Reuse shared design patterns and layout wrappers.
- Ensure that no duplicate submission can occur with the same token.

Ask questions or inspect current structure before proceeding.
