# API Fixes for GRC and Policies Pages

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes made to resolve API issues between the GRC and Policies pages in the Cyber Hub platform.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Inconsistent API Structure**
- **Problem**: Standards and Procedures APIs were missing key endpoints and functionality compared to Policies API
- **Solution**: 
  - Added missing `/visibility` and `/versions` endpoints for Standards and Procedures
  - Updated all API routes to have consistent structure and error handling
  - Added proper validation for all endpoints

### 2. **Next.js 15+ Compatibility**
- **Problem**: API routes were using synchronous `params` which is deprecated in Next.js 15+
- **Solution**:
  - Updated all API routes to use async `params` with proper `await`
  - Fixed type definitions for `params: Promise<{ id: string }>`
  - Ensured compatibility with latest Next.js version

### 3. **File Upload Support**
- **Problem**: Standards and Procedures APIs didn't support file uploads in update operations
- **Solution**:
  - Added comprehensive file upload support to Standards and Procedures update routes
  - Implemented file validation (type and size checks)
  - Added proper file archiving and version management

### 4. **Data Structure Inconsistencies**
- **Problem**: Policies page interface was missing `is_visible` field
- **Solution**:
  - Updated Policy interface in Policies page to include `is_visible` field
  - Ensured all three types (Policies, Standards, Procedures) have consistent data structures

### 5. **Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent error handling across API endpoints
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper validation for all ID parameters
  - Implemented consistent error responses
  - Added detailed error logging

### 6. **Missing Endpoints**
- **Problem**: Standards and Procedures were missing visibility and versions endpoints
- **Solution**:
  - Created `/api/standards/[id]/visibility/route.ts`
  - Created `/api/standards/[id]/versions/route.ts`
  - Created `/api/procedures/[id]/visibility/route.ts`
  - Created `/api/procedures/[id]/versions/route.ts`

## File Changes

### API Routes Updated
- `src/app/api/policies/[id]/route.ts` - Enhanced with better validation
- `src/app/api/standards/[id]/route.ts` - Added file upload support and validation
- `src/app/api/procedures/[id]/route.ts` - Added file upload support and validation
- `src/app/api/standards/[id]/view/route.ts` - Added ID validation
- `src/app/api/standards/[id]/download/route.ts` - Added ID validation
- `src/app/api/procedures/[id]/view/route.ts` - Added ID validation
- `src/app/api/procedures/[id]/download/route.ts` - Added ID validation

### New API Routes Created
- `src/app/api/standards/[id]/visibility/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/standards/[id]/versions/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/procedures/[id]/visibility/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/procedures/[id]/versions/route.ts`

### Frontend Pages Updated
- `src/app/grc/page.tsx` - Fixed API endpoint handling for all tabs
- `src/app/policies/page.tsx` - Added `is_visible` field to interface

### Infrastructure
- Created upload directories with proper .gitignore
- Added file validation (PDF and Word documents only, max 10MB)
- Implemented proper file archiving system

## Validation Rules

### File Upload Validation
- **Allowed Types**: PDF, Word documents (.doc, .docx)
- **Maximum Size**: 10MB
- **File Naming**: Timestamp-based unique names with sanitized original names

### API Response Validation
- All endpoints now return consistent error formats
- Proper HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500)
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **File Upload Testing**:
   - Test uploading different file types (PDF, Word, invalid types)
   - Test file size limits
   - Test file update functionality

2. **API Endpoint Testing**:
   - Test all CRUD operations for Policies, Standards, and Procedures
   - Test visibility toggle functionality
   - Test version management
   - Test download and view count increments

3. **Error Handling Testing**:
   - Test with invalid IDs
   - Test with missing required fields
   - Test with invalid file types/sizes

## Security Considerations

- File upload validation prevents malicious file uploads
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- File size limits prevent DoS attacks
- Unique file naming prevents conflicts

## Performance Improvements

- Efficient file handling with proper buffer management
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Reduced API response times with better error handling
